Wise, Michelini, Zbozinek, Hagan & Mobbs (2020)

## Data

All necessary data is available here in the `/data` directory.

## Code

Notebooks are provided in the `/notebooks` directory, which include all relevant code and outputs. 

The main results are produced using the `ARVIS_analysis_notebook.Rmd` R Markdown notebook (original notebook in `.Rmd`, also provided in `.md` which can be viewed on GitHub). Some of the figures are produced in Python using the `ARVIS_figures.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, because I have never figured out how to use ggplot.
